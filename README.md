## Module 20 Challenge

In this project, a smart contract is compiled and deployed with the ability to deposit to the contract account and withdraw to 2 additional accounts.  Transactions can be verified by checking which account was the last to make a withdrawal and the amount that was withdrawn.  The contract balance can also be checked after each transaction.
